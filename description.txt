Software Technologies

In the software technologies group, we conduct research centered
around methods, techniques, and tools for the creation, analysis
and application of software systems. The research is performed using a
wide range of methods including

creative???--studying or supporting the creation of software systems

theoretical--programming languages, algorithms, type systems,
..., used to create software systems

empirical--experiments and systematic observations of software
systems or using software systems to analyse big amounts of data

engineering--measuring properties of software systems, tool
support for building software systems 



Important research areas are:

Software notations and tools
	 Programming language features
	 Type Systems
	 Software metrics
	 
Information systems applications
	    Data mining programming
	    Machine learning programming

Theory of computation
       Design and analysis of algorithms
       Theory and algorithms for application domains
